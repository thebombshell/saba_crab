# Saba Crab

Hey, I made a saba crab model and rig, and a small character control in godot to demo it.

It is here for anyone to use, copy, or modify for any purpose, so long as they link back to this repository so others can grab it too.

I might do more with this and make a little game out of it, I might just leave it be as something fun for everyone else to play with.

# Shellectathon Platformer

This project is an attempt to make a Collectathon Platformer using the Saba Crab base.

I intend to use this as a reasont o expand the rig, the model library around it, and provide others interested, with a more developped base for fan projects.

### A little disclaimer and declaration

I'll never seek to profit from this project, its a fan game made simply for the fun of it.

I may reuse the systems for unrelated projects later down the line, but this project will remain open source and non-profit at all times.

## External Assets Used

While I am trying to make as much of the assets myself as possible, I can not make them all, and so this section will give credit and original links.

I am not going to use anything that isn't already approved for royalty-free commersional use. Not because I intend to profit, but because those are assets I know were posted online specifically for anyone to use.
