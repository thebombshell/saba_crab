# Saba Crab

Hey, I made a saba crab model and rig, and a small character control in godot to demo it.

It is here for anyone to use, copy, or modify for any purpose, so long as they link back to this repository so others can grab it too.

I might do more with this and make a little game out of it, I might just leave it be as something fun for everyone else to play with.
